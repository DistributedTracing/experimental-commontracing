# Warning: experimental

This is just a test repository where we're sketching out potential reference implementations of tracing.
We're just experimenting with things like a ContinuationLocal construct, and push/pop semantics.

The ContinuationLocal is a partial port of Twitter's https://github.com/twitter/util/blob/develop/util-core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/util/Local.scala
